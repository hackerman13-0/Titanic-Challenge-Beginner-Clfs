# Titanic-Challenge-Beginner-Clfs
Submission for the Kaggle Titanic Challenge Hey Guys this is my submission for the Kaggle Titanic Challenge! 
I got a 93% Training Accuracy and a 83% Validation Accuracy So i think it is pretty ok considering the amount of data given.
Feel Free to Fork any data and star it if you like the work and i'm open to constructive criticism as always 
and please let me know if any help is needed in the Power BI Visualizations or any Intuition regarding the algorithms, 
I am always open to help! 
if i don't answer here, you can mail me at the_kg@outlook.com A question to anyone, 
If anyone can tell me how to position gifs side by side and resize them before placing them in kaggle notebooks and Google Colab, It would be of great help! Thanks Again!
